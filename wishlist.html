      <p>
        If you want to give me a present but don't know what, give me a book, and I will be happy.
        I'm interested in a few kinds of books.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Book you love.</strong> It should be something you enjoyed a lot and want to share
        that joy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Book you want to read.</strong> There are more books than I could read and picking
        the right one is a tough choice. If you already picked one, I want to read it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Good book from your professional domain.</strong> Maybe you know chemistry and have
        found that rare, formula-filled, thousand-page manuscript that contains the best chemistry
        knowledge. I want it. I may not be able to understand it now but I might in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regarding book's condition. Most books I buy are used books. Knowing someone else touched it
        and shared the joy of reading warms my heart. If you have a dusty book, full of pencil marks
        and coffee spills, that you've read so many times that some pages are torn, that is the
        perfect gift for me.
